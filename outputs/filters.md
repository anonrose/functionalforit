there are moments in your life you have to become something else to get to your goal

it's almost like the filter of society removing things, people, experiences from your life, they're shrugged off in pursuit of something

filters

be good at school -
are you interested in this thing, lack focus
i wasn't until i found cs in college, couldn't care less about school, it was boring and pointless, i got like a 2.0 gpa in hs and never once did homework. flunked out of the first college i went to because i had no clue of what major i was going to take, i just was told i needed to be there

get a job -
welp, gotta support myself, also i definitely don't want to be doing this for forever, better work my ass off so i can make as much money as possible and stop doing this, save save save save to the point you're skipping meals to invest in the s&p

a partner -
societal expectations of what they are, or your own, does it really even matter, don't you just want love and support

dream job -
the fuck does that even mean, don't you just want to value the people, your work, and spend time with in pursuit of something larger than the individual self

```js

let expectations = ['school', 'job', 'partner', 'career'];
kyle = expectations.filter(expectation => {
  return !kyle.isDefinedBy(expectation) && kyle.findMeaningBeyond(expectation);
});
```
