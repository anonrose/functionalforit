hopelessness of not enough

you won't ever get there, she doesn't exist

society tells you she does, whatever she is

there's no such thing as the perfect partner

every spousal relationship in my life has come to an end.

parents. relatives. friend's parents. friends.

is it the ever lasting we're looking for or the journey of self discovery through another.

they've all taught me about myself and offered empathy to a being that wasn't aware or capable of accepting.

“I have never had a love affair. Never have I been in love, though I have dreamed of it so much, day and night, in my dreams I have imagined to myself such love, with such scenes, such adventures, that I could not have stood it in reality—I should have been shattered into fragments under the first caress of my beloved’s hand.”

i don't know, were you worthy of one, what is worthy, who are you pretending to be, for her, the non-existant
