A glance, a movement, a deathly touch

Weak men crumble, strong women loathe

Extracting ambition, worth and dignity on the potential of love

Their presence is fleeting, their movements enchanting and words are drawing

Deflect from their past in search of an answer to yours

Spot them and flag them as their courtship is deception
