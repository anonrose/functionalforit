money is a store of value.

take that in.

money is not:

status, self-worth, to be desired

at face value you can see the things money _does_ and can provide you as society tells you it provides:

status, self-worth and therefore should be desired

all money does is provide value to be used

that value is in the eye of the spender

what is it your values are ?

time, family, friends

what you spend your time doing and who you spend it with reflect what you spend your money on

if your values are not good what you spend money on is therefore not good as that's what you're valuing

you call these people your friends, what you spend your time doing fun, and ignore your family

they are not conducive of your values therefore you will not have money as it is eaten away due to misaligned values

the people you focus on do not value _you_ therefore it is a waste, focus on things that you provide value, and provides you value and it's _value_ you shall have
